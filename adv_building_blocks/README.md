#Advanced Building Blocks
Some more programming problems from The Odin Project's [Projects: Advanced Building Blocks](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks)
##Bubble Sort
To run, use `ruby bubble_sort.rb`.
+ `#bubble_sort` takes an array and sorts using the bubble sort method.
+ `#bubble_sort_by` also sorts an array using the bubble sort method, but expects a block that's used to compare two elements of the array.

##Enumerable Methods
To use methods, `require './enumerable_methods'`.
+ Extends Ruby's Enumerable module with reworked implementations of each method (`#my_each` vs. `#each`).
