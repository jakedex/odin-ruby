# Event Manager
My implementation of Jumpstart Lab [EventManager tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html).

This program parses a CSV file full of registrations for an upcoming political event. It then cleans up some of the data and uses the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/)’s API to fetch representatives for a given area. After, it uses an ERB template to create an HTML ‘thank you’ email.
