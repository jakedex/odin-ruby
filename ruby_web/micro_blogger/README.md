# MicroBlogger
My solution to the [MicroBlogger tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html) from Jumpstart Lab.

This client interacts with the Twitter messaging service - mimicking native functionality of the actual web interface along with adding many more features.

_Note: I have excluded the twitter_settings.yml file out of security concerns, therefore the program will not function properly_
